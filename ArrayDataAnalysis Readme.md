# Arrays & Basic Data Analysis Program

## Description
This is a simple Java console application.  
The program stores numerical data using arrays, performs basic data analysis operations such as sum, average, maximum, and minimum, and displays the results.  
It also demonstrates manual sorting, multi-dimensional arrays, and exception handling.

## Features
- Stores data using single-dimensional arrays
- Calculates sum, average, maximum, and minimum
- Implements manual sorting without built-in methods
- Demonstrates multi-dimensional (2D) arrays
- Handles ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
- Displays formatted console output

## Concepts Used
- Single-dimensional arrays
- Multi-dimensional arrays
- for loops
- if conditions
- Exception handling (try-catch)
- Manual sorting (Bubble Sort)
- Scanner class
- Console input and output

## Files Included
- ArrayDataAnalysis.java

## How to Run
1. Compile the program:  
   javac ArrayDataAnalysis.java

2. Run the program:  
   java ArrayDataAnalysis

## Output
The program displays:
- Sum
- Average
- Maximum value
- Minimum value
- Sorted array
- 2D array output
